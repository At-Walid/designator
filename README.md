# DESIGNATOR: : a Tool for Automated GAN-based Testing of DNNs in Martian Environments
This project provides a GUI-based testing framework for evaluating the robustness and accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using a high-fidelity Mars simulator built with Unreal Engine. The simulator is embedded directly into the GUI, allowing researchers and practitioners to visually observe how segmentation models perform under a variety of simulated terrain and lighting conditions.

---

## üñ• Features

- GUI with simulator control and real-time visual feedback
- Multi-objective genetic search for input generation
- Integration of GAN (Pix2PixHD) for realism-aware image transformation
- DNN prediction visualization and mask comparison
- Automatic fitness scoring using IoU and feature-based diversity
- Search variants (DESIGNATE, DESIGNATE_SINGLE, DESIGNATE_PIXEL, etc.)

## üì∑ GUI Overview

- Simulated Image (raw synthetic from simulator)
- Realistic Image (GAN-enhanced)
- Label Image (ground truth segmentation)
- Prediction Image (model output)
- Fitness scores and archive size display

---

## ‚ö† Requirements

- **Windows OS**  
  The tool requires Windows **because the simulator is built using Unreal Engine** and is currently only compiled as a Windows executable (`Mars.exe`).

- **GPU Support**  
  The tool requires a **CUDA-compatible GPU** for inference using PyTorch and MXNet-based models.

## üß™ How to Use

### 1. üì¶ Download the package

Download the tool from Zenodo.

---

### 2. üõ†Ô∏è Create and activate a new Python 3.10 virtual environment

Open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment with Python 3.10
python -m venv venv_py310

# Activate the environment
venv_py310\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip to ensure compatibility
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Upgrade pip to ensure compatibility
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

# Install AirSim manually
cd DESIGNATE_Tool_PY3.10\AirSim\PythonClient
python setup.py install

# Launch the GUI tool
cd ../../
python .\app\run.py
```

Make sure python and pip versions are both 3.10


## üìå Limitations

- ‚ùå Not supported on Linux/macOS (due to `Mars.exe` dependency)
- ‚ùå Requires discrete GPU (NVIDIA CUDA support)
- ‚ùå Simulator must be manually recompiled for non-Windows targets (if needed)
